dungeon creator

room has a width of 3,5,7,...,13
room has a height of 3,5,7,...,13
room can have a door at n,e,s or w (1-4 doors). always middle
if a room has more than one door it can turn into a corridor
weighting on the chance of having an opposite door (so a S door may be more likely if a N door exists)
weighting on the chance of a room becoming a corridor
start with a room
    loop through each door
    create a room for that door with a door to match the parent
stop when
    certain floor area has been created
    use thread idea and stop when all threads end in a room with one door (entrance only)
consider trap doors/stairs
    5th(/6th) door type
    way to move to another level
    needs to be link between two, so level knows where to start user
need to restrict child rooms so that they don't overlap
    if a small room leads to a large room north and east those rooms would overlap
    need a formula to work out how to restrict room size so as to be possible
    or to loop through rooms after creation and shrink any necessary

can i do secret doors? how would they work?
    maybe just a weighted chance of a door becoming secret
    only for doors leading to a single room?
    weighted chance of an end room becoming secret

maybe have pre-arranged furniture layouts for rooms


======== !
issue of rooms overlapping and not matching
    room may create a child east
    a room above and to the right may create a room to the south
    these rooms need to be the same room!
    for this to happen dimensions need to match up
