room has a width of 3,5,7,...,13
room has a height of 3,5,7,...,13
room can have a door at n,e,s or w (1-4 doors). always middle
if a room has a opposite doors (n+s or e+w) it can turn into a corridor
weighting on the chance of having an opposite door (so a S door may be more likely if a N door exists)
weighting on the chance of a room becoming a corridor
start with a room
    loop through each door
    create a room for that door with a door to match the parent
stop when
    certain floor area has been created
    use thread idea and stop when all threads end in a room with one door (entrance only)
consider trap doors/stairs
    5th(/6th) door type
    way to move to another level
    needs to be link between two, so level knows where to start user


can i do secret doors? how would they work?
    maybe just a weighted chance of a door becoming secret
    only for doors leading to a single room?
    weighted chance of an end room becoming secret

maybe have pre-arranged furniture layouts for rooms
