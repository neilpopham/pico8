--------------------

Hey there, folks. This year has been a LOT in many ways.

Many stressful things.

So I just want to share wonderful things with you all.

And sure, secret prizes, but easily found by the clever.

But to the point -- so many wonderful riches await you!

We have SONGS and SOUNDS by the amazing Gruber!

We have special sprites from SmellyFishsticks!

We have SFX by Bikibird!

You get the original startcarts for TBJs 1, 2, and 3....

For other resources, read "A Winter's Poem".

I wish you the best holiday season and peace.

P.S. When you open your present... you may have to open them again....
