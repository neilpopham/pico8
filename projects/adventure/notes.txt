keys to open doors
buttons to open barriers
ladders
sometimes you may have to take a different route back to get through
tooltip indicator to show whether door is locked
flies/moths that scitter around gradually following a path but with randomness
frogs? or at least jumping blobs
hidden rooms will have to be created using a table and rendered using spr()
    - trigger cell (cell player walks into to trigger display)
    - top left map position
    - grid of sprites
    - {trigger={12,34},origin={56,78},spr={{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8}}}
    - maybe:
        when trigger cell hit room is set in map
        when trigger cell left room is removed
        will need to store overwritten sprites
        may need to know the direction of the room for knowing when to show/hide  
when laser beam on screen play buzzing noise
    - maybe volume related to distance
