get spiders working
show current gun in hud (2x1 sprites)
place new guns in map
try a grenade launch bullet type (angled and bouncing)
- can be used by an enemy and player gun
maybe take multiplier off camera and up values currently passed through
change medikit to white case?
check how many sprites we actually can use!
way to pick enemies:
- pick a number depending on the level
- create pool from all picked starting with most difficult
- limit pool so that easier ones slowly get missed out
- use that pool when setting map
use a counter to make enemies jump
- as counter ticks down simulate button press
create scene transition
{{7},nil,nil,{15,10},nil,{6},nil,nil,{9},{14},{11,12},nil,{13},nil,{4},{8},{3,5},nil,{2},nil,nil,{1}}
